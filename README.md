# Text Spam Detector
## Overview
The goal of this project was to classify text messages based on their content as spam, using a supervised learning approach. This notebook contains a complete implementation of a text message classification model and the creation of a Gradio web app to use the spam detector.

## How to Use App
- Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
- Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
- Use gradio link to submit text messages for classification in input textbox.
